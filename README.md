SIT_II.R:

simulation of % of vaccinated on a period. The vaccine is 100% efficient on this model. Each 6 graphs represent the proportion of 
population that is susceptible, infected, or removed over a period.


SIR_III_without_vaccine.R:
simulations of different percent of the population becoming susceptible by unit of time. Individuals are divided as susceptible, infected, or removed. 

SIR_III.R:
4 graphs representing the proportion of population that is susceptible, infected, or removed with a different percent of vaccinate and 20% 
of the population become susceptible over a period.
